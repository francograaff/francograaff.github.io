At the start of the GSD's Design Discovery course, students were asked to pick a generic building type to investigate for the duration of the program. I chose the courtyard tenement, and spent the next few weeks analyzing Alfred Messel's 24 Kurfürstendamm in particular, a residential building completed in 1893 in Berlin.

My final assignment removed the building from its original climate and placed it in São Paulo, and I modified the building's original design to reflect this new social and environmental context.
