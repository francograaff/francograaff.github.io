#### Problem Statement

Students new to New York City studying at Columbia and Barnard often find it challenging to locate establishments and services in the area that cater to their needs as students. 

Without a centralized platform for students to receive and share personalized business recommendations for the neighborhoods around campus, students struggle to find essential businesses that fit their budgets and preferences.

#### Understanding Users

An initial round of contextual inquiry and affinity diagramming processes yielded the following takeaways:

1. Maps can be overwhelming and too tedious to handle on-the-go. One interviewee said they would rather just interact with a list.
2. Target users like a sense of community. Making something Columbia-specific adds value to them.
3. Target users want to keep up with their friends.
4. Target users want to be able to have an identity/profile to
exhibit.

#### Lo-Fi Prototyping

Based on these findings, we developed some initial prototypes.

Wireframe testing revealed a desire for  more visuals and emphasis on photos of places. Profiles and seeing friends' recommendations are important—students are used to and enjoy interacting with feeds, followers, and other social features.

Maps are useful, especially when exploring or trying to gauge distance—but in the context of our app it seemed to hinder our users' abilities to complete different tasks.

#### Iterative Development

As we further evaluated designs with users, I developed a design system to streamline prototyping and ensure visual consistency at scale.

#### Final Design

Our final design solution serves as a comprehensive platform for students new to New York City, specifically those studying at Columbia and Barnard, to discover local establishments and services that cater to their needs as students.

The app facilitates this by allowing users to search and filter through various categories, such as art, fitness, food, and fashion, to find personalized recommendations from students.

I produced all designs and diagrams featured on this page.
